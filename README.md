# NortonAssessment
Exoplanet Exercise

Hello Team,

Thanks for sharing such an interesting take-home assessment with me. 

I was able to complete the assessment successfully, I have attached the screenshots of the solution as well as I have also pasted the answers under the Solution folder in my repository. You can verify the answers for all the three questions given.

I have implemented the logic for all the three questions under seperate folder/classes -> NortonAssessment/NortonAssessment2/src/main/java/com/nortonassessment/questions/ 

Please do let me know, if you have any questions about the logic or how I have implemented the code.
